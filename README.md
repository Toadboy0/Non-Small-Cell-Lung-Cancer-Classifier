The objective of this project is to develop and implement a streamlined pipeline specifically designed for efficient image data extraction,
optimized for subsequent processing through a neural network architecture. A key focus of this pipeline is its minimal reliance on VRAM and
processing power, making it highly suitable for environments with constrained hardware resources. This approach addresses the challenge of 
handling image data in a resource-efficient manner, ensuring that the pipeline is both effective in data extraction and compatible with low-end
systems. The end goal is to create a solution that maintains high performance in image processing tasks while significantly reducing the hardware
demands typically associated with such operations, thereby making advanced neural network applications more accessible and practical for a wider 
range of users and computational environments.

The data set used for this project was found on Kaggle, there may be differences with the file structure which need to be checked before running.
To run this script locally in a notebook, ensure that the data set file structure matches that in the code OR edit the data extraction code blocks.
